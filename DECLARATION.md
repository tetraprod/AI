# UnifiedAI Declaration

UnifiedAI is developed around three guiding principles:

## Adaptivity
UnifiedAI adapts to user needs and changing environments. The modular engines
(Soul, Brain, Optical, Aura) can be tuned at runtime and the optional
`NetworkFeatureManager` enables network features such as smart packet shaping or
path diversity. These capabilities let the system respond dynamically to varying
conditions and interaction patterns.

## Resilience
Each engine operates independently so failures can be isolated. Memories are
persisted in SQLite while the optical subsystem uses Redis for fast messaging.
This layered design helps UnifiedAI recover from faults and continue operating
under load or partial outages.

## Radical Transparency
All interactions are validated through **AuraEngine**, which checks against
`ethics_rules.json` before and after generation. **OpticalEngine** broadcasts
logs over Redis so external observers can track activity. Combined with the
`/metrics` endpoint, these mechanisms provide clear visibility into how the
engines make decisions and handle data.

UnifiedAI orchestrates these engines so that incoming text is first screened by
AuraEngine, then passed to SoulEngine and BrainEngine for empathetic reasoning,
with OpticalEngine logging the whole process. This coordination enforces the
principles above and keeps the system adaptable, resilient, and transparent.
