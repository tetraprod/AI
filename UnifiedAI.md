# UnifiedAI

=======
=======
`UnifiedAI` is a minimal async engine that relies on Redis for short term storage.
It exposes a `connect()` method to establish the connection and a `close()`
coroutine to gracefully shut it down.

## Shutdown behavior

When used inside an application's lifespan context, ensure `close()` is awaited
on shutdown so the Redis connection is released:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from unified_ai import lifespan

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

The provided context manager automatically invokes `engine.close()` after the
`yield`, ensuring Redis resources are released.
=======
UnifiedAI is a modular architecture that combines four engines to provide empathetic interactions, reasoning, high‑speed data processing and ethical oversight.  It exposes a small FastAPI service for demonstration purposes.

## Components and Intent

- **SoulEngine** – uses a DistilBERT emotion classifier to craft empathetic replies.
- **BrainEngine** – stores memories in SQLite, applies rule-based reasoning, and learns from interactions.
- **OpticalEngine** – publishes events through Redis with optional networking features like smart packet shaping.
- **AuraEngine** – validates output against rules loaded from `ethics_rules.json` for ethical compliance.
=======
=======
- **SoulEngine** – detects sentiment in user messages and crafts human‑like replies.
- **BrainEngine** – stores memories in SQLite and performs simple reasoning based on past interactions.
- **OpticalEngine** – communicates through Redis channels to broadcast events.
- **AuraEngine** – checks messages for forbidden content to enforce basic ethical rules.

The orchestrator coordinates these engines so that input flows through AuraEngine for validation, then SoulEngine and BrainEngine to generate a reply, while OpticalEngine publishes logs asynchronously.

## Running the Example

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start a local Redis server (required for the OpticalEngine).
3. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   python unified_ai.py
   ```
4. Interact with the system using `curl` or any HTTP client:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Hello there"}'
=======
=======
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"message": "Hello there"}' http://localhost:8000/chat
   ```

The request is processed asynchronously. The reply contains an empathetic acknowledgement, demonstrates memory use and the message is published to Redis.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /query` – send a user query and receive the AI's response.
- `GET /health` – check Redis connectivity and list enabled features.
- `GET /metrics` – view memory count and enabled network features.
