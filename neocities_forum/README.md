# ô╥┴ÿ`■,36▌ Demo Forum

This folder contains a minimal example of a simple group forum suitable for static
sites like Neocities. It exposes a tiny Python backend and a single page HTML
interface.

## Running

Start the backend server:

```bash
python server.py
```

Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve it with `python -m http.server`).
The page lets anyone create groups, post messages and vote on group rules without
any login.
